$t1 = 1012, Memory not modified

cycle 3: sub $t3, $t1, $t0
$t3 = 12, Memory not modified

cycle 4: DRAM request issued

cycle 5: addi $t4, $zero, 100
$t4 = 100, Memory not modified

cycle 6: addi $t5, $zero, 2
$t5 = 2, Memory not modified

cycle 7: mul $t6, $t4, $t5
$t6 = 200, Memory not modified

cycle 8: slt $t7, $t6, $t5
No register modified, Memory not modified

cycle 5-16: No register modified, Updated memory address 1004-1007 = 12, Activated row 0 and accessed address 1004

cycle 17-26: write back row buffer to DRAM

Clock Cycles: 26

1004-1007 = 12

Total Buffer Updates: 2
