cycle 1: addi $t0, $zero, 1000
$t0 = 1000, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 2: addi $t1, $zero, 1012
$t1 = 1012, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 3: addi $t2, $zero, 10
$t2 = 10, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 4: addi $t3, $zero, 20
$t3 = 20, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 5: DRAM request issued

cycle 6-17: sw $t3, 0($t0)
No register modified, Updated memory address 1000-1003 = 20, Activated row 0

cycle 18: addi $t3, $t3, 2
$t3 = 22, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 19: DRAM request issued

cycle 20-21: lw $t6, 0($t0)
$t6 = 20, Row buffer not modified, Accessed the value at a column address in row buffer

cycle 22: add $t7, $t6, $t6
$t7 = 40, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 23-32: write back row buffer to DRAM

Clock Cycles: 32

1000-1003 = 20
