cycle 5: DRAM request issued

cycle 6-17: No register modified, Updated memory address 1000-1003 = 20, Activated row 0 and accessed address 1000

cycle 18: addi $t3, $t3, 2
$t3 = 22, Memory not modified

cycle 19: DRAM request issued

cycle 20-21: $t6=20, Row buffer not updated, Accessed address 1000 from row buffer

cycle 22: add $t7, $t6, $t6
