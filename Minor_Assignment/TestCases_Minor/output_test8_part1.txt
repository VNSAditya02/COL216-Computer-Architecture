cycle 5: DRAM request issued

cycle 6-17: sw $t3, 0($t0)
No register modified, Updated memory address 1000-1003 = 20, Activated row 0

cycle 18: mul $t3, $t2, $t3
$t3 = 200, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 19: DRAM request issued

cycle 20-21: lw $s0, 0($t0)
$s0 = 20, Row buffer not modified, Accessed the value at a column address in row buffer

cycle 22: bne $s0, $t0, 13
No register modified, Row buffer not modified, No DRAM activity

cycle 23-32: write back row buffer to DRAM
