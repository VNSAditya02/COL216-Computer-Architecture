cycle 4: addi $t3, $zero, 20
$t3 = 20, Memory not modified

cycle 5: DRAM request issued

cycle 6-17: No register modified, Updated memory address 1000-1003 = 20, Activated row 0 and accessed address 1000

cycle 18: mul $t3, $t2, $t3
$t3 = 200, Memory not modified

cycle 19: DRAM request issued

cycle 20-21: $s0=20, Row buffer not updated, Accessed address 1000 from row buffer

cycle 22: bne $s0, $t0, 13
$s0 = 20, Memory not modified

cycle 23-32: write back row buffer to DRAM

Clock Cycles: 32

1000-1003 = 20
